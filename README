crmt is ...

-- A rewrite of MT_Toy (which is poorly written for CINT)
   http://github.com/dougphy/CRMT_Software
-- A way to seperate event generation and simulated event display

Under construction

Done:
-- File I/O
-- User config file
-- Module geometric definition
-- Muon line definition
-- Intersect line with extrusion locations
-- Multiplex
-- True 2D evd
-- Sim 2d evd

Urgent todo:
-- cos2(theta) dist.

Not started:
-- True event display 3D
-- Sim event display 3D

In the end, simulation and reconstruction will be a single software.
Reconstruction currently being developed at http://github.com/vgenty/crmt_feb
